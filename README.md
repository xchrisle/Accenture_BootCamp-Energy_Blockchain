# Accenture Bootcamp - February 2018 

## Disclaimer

The project is based off a hypothetical business idea at Accenture Sydney's Technology bootcamp from the 19th of February to the 22nd of February. This repository exist to keep a copy of the original repository on one of the developer's github account. The original repository is [here](https://github.com/firew0rks/smart-meter-client)

We also won the competitions.

## Project

### Context

In 2018, it's normal to see houses having 1 or 2 solar panels in conjunction with the regular energy wires from their electricity providers. When the day is sunny, some of the electircity created from solar energy can be used instead of electricity from the grid, to save money. However, what do we do if we produce excess electiricty? 

### Idea

Currently, if we do produce excess electricity from solar panels, we sell it back to the grid for about 70% of the current price. Seems a bit unfair in a monopoly right? Well, here's where the idea comes in. What if we sell our excess energy to our neighbour, who doesn't have solar panels. 

The project was to create an application that can support an energy sharing grid that uses blockchain technology. It creates an 'energy ethereum token' whenever excess electricity is created, which can be traded/sold to other households in the same grid. 

If we allow a Prosumer (someone who produces electricity at one point in time, and consumes electricity at other time) to sell energy tokens at 80% of the energy market rate, consumers to buy at 90% of the energy market rate (giving both parties a reason to participate), we're able to make an arbritage profit of 10% per transaction.
